# CSGO_Recode.lua

Hey everyone!
Usually when I code, it's because I'm either making a game, Recoding a game, or because I am just bored during school. So as another project is being 
begun, I am recoding Counter Strike Global Offensive. It will of course not have all features, and will require a specific workspace and explorer, as I 
am coding .lua, but I am going to get the basic game down. Feel free to msg me at jimmyrlader@gmail.com or on Discord at Jimster#1ooo (probably will change)
if you find any errors or find something that I could do better. I am always looking for new tips and tricks in coding, because though I know how to do it, 
I am not exactly the best scripter out there. Anyway, if you feel like checking up every now and then, go right ahead.
